\title{Efficiently Inferring Non-hierarchical Structure in Parsing and Computation}
\date{\today}

\maketitle

\textit{Abstract:} This paper proposes to revise the general definition of a ``grammar''\todocite{grammar defn} as well as ``parsing''\todocite{parsing defn}. A meta-language named ``Simultaneous Productions'' (or ``S.P'') is proposed for specifying a parseable grammar (similar in intent to EBNF\todocite{EBNF}). This meta-language is shown to be able to represent recursively enumerable languages\todocite{RecEnum defn}, and several favorable properties of this meta-language across various parsing use cases are discussed.

An actual ``evaluation method'' (or ``parsing algorithm'') is then introduced for the proposed S.P. grammar model, which shares some similarities with the CYK algorithm \todocite{CYK algorithm!}.This method is shown to terminate in \todo{parsing runtime?} time across \todo{parsing inputs?} inputs. This method is then demonstrated to have the peculiar property of directly parameterizing context-sensitivity \todocite{context-sensitivity defn} \todo{is this peculiar?}. The practical and theoretical ramifications of this result are discussed and speculated on.

\textit{This paper will frequently refer to free software provided at \cite{repo-sp} which implements all of the theoretical mechanisms discussed.}

\textit{TODO:}
\begin{itemize}
\item describe the hierarchy as being better described by derivatives (?) of a function corresponding to stack depth (!!!) and link it to approximation difficulty!\todocite{approximation difficulty/the PCP theorem}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textit{the important link here is between the \# of derivatives required to approximate the function and the taylor series!}
\end{itemize}
\item make S.P. support multiple parallel stacks, then reduce \secref{sec:meta-language-for-grammar-specification} to a $k$-stack automaton (equivalent to a T.M.!)\todocite{$k$-stack automaton definition, equivalence to 2-stack automaton, equivalence to T.M.}
