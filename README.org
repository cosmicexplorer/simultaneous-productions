#+TITLE: simultaneous-productions
#+STARTUP: showall

A Rust parser combinator library efficiently implementing "simultaneous productions", a model equivalent to a Turing Machine (I think). The method of simultaneous productions allows specifying languages extremely naturally, and maps perfectly to the parser combinator operations I have in mind. It can also be implemented with a linear (?) partitioning algorithm.

* TODO [0/5]
- [ ] specify a simple language so that it compiles
  - use fixed strings instead of regex for now
- [ ] implement the simple language so that it can be parsed
- [ ] make a simple language that is usable for some simple task
  - csv parsing? /or at least a simple subset of it/
- [ ] develop benchmarking and (fuzz)? testing methods
- [ ] parse C and C++
